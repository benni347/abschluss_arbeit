Today I decided against Websockets, because I worked the whole last week trying to fix a bug which occured becuase of object Futer. I think I am going to use WebRTC with tcp, and their data channels to transmit the msg.

I decided for [this](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/pion/webrtc/v3) webrtc module for go.
